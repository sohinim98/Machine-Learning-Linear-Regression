# Machine-Learning-Project
This repository contains linear regression gradient descnet (a machine learning algorithm) to perform real-life tasks.
I have implpemented linear regression in Octave/Matlab to predict profits for a food truck based on the population of a city.
I have implemented gradient descent, a Machine Learning algorithm and have fed training examples to the algorithm from which it autmotically learns to predict the profit in a new city (ie. for a new example).
(There is also a warmUpExercise file which has a simple task to help me get familiar with Octave/Matlab commands.)
